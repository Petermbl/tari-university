# Zero-knowledge Proof Protocols and Rank-1 Constraint Systems



Fast and efficient transaction validation is one of the main reasons for Layer 2 Scaling, especially for blockchains using confidential transactions. Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) are used to achieve faster zero-knowledge proofs, particularly in zk-SNARKs and Bulletproofs. 



An R1CS is “basically a language for arithmetic circuits with bilinear gates” [1.] It defines a set of bilinear equations that serve as constraints suitable for ZK proofs [2.]   



***Tentatively***, the report will be split into two parts; 

​	PART I	: **R1CS in zk-SNARKs** 

​	PART II	: **R1CS in Bulletproofs**
